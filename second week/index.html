    <h1>Encyclopedia on a Day in the Life of My Dog</h1>
    <h2> My dog, Oliver, is the main thing in life I know well. He possess many features that make him better than any other dog. </h2>
    <h4> He was born in September of 2020, to a silver lab mother and black poodle father. He had eight other siblings who all look shockingly unrelated, besides the way they great people, by putting their entire mouth around your wrist! </h4>
    <h5> He holds many nicknames, a few being: Ollie, Moose, Smoochie, and Bestie Dog! </h5>

    <h5> After a nice day in the sun, Ollie is in need of some serious cool down time. He often plays in the mini pool outside or runs to catch the water from the hose. Oliver could quite literally do this for hours on end. </h5>
    <h6> Fun Fact: Many labradoodles like to swim but need slight training. In Olivers case, he enjoys standing in the pool, but he will never sit down or lay. We have yet to figure out why! </h6>

    <h5> Once the clock strikes 7 PM, it is time for dinner. My family found a dog food brand conveniently called "Ollie", to which we feed Oliver this food every night. </h5>
    <h5> After eating, Ollie is wiped out. He spends his evenings laying on the cold wood floor and waiting for somebody to get into bed so he can follow. </h5>
    <h6> Fun Fact: Thankfully Oliver is a hypoallergenic labradoodle, otherwise my entire family would deep dive into a puddle of allergies. </h6>
